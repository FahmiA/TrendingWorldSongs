TrendingWorldSongs
==================

A simple EchoNest-powered website to preview popular songs from around the world.

Setup Instructions:

1. You'll need an EchoNest API key. You can get one here: http://the.echonest.com/. Add it to the "ECHONEST\_API\_KEY" variable in js/main.js.
2. To run the page, launch your webserver. Running "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" from the root of the repo folder will do the trick (the folder with index.html).
3. Navigate to the page (http://localhost:8000/ from the settings in step 2).
