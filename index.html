        <h1>Trending Songs from Around the World</h1>

        <p id="introText">
            Listen to popular music produced from around the world.
            Use the world map below to click on a country.
            You'll hear a sample of the music produced from artists from that country which are currently trending.
            Use the audio controls to skip boring songs and replay the good ones, you may discover some good music that you've never heard of before!
            It's interesting to contrast the different kinds of music played from neighbouring countries.
            But keep in mind, this site is purely an experiment developed in my free time. Some parts may not work properly, trending songs may not be accurate, and some country playlists are much shorter than others.
            Enjoy!

                This site is powered by three powerful tools.
                The <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a> library is used to visualise the world map (using <a href="https://github.com/markmarkoh/datamaps/blob/master/src/js/data/world.json" target="_blank">Mark DiMarco's</a> world data).
                The <a href="http://echonest.com/" target="_blank">Echo Nest</a> provides information about music, artists, and what music is currently trending.
                The <a href="http://www.7digital.com/" target="_blank">7Digital</a> service provides the song previews to listen to.
